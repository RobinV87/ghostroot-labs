**Ghostroot Doctrine v1.0**
*Rules of Engagement, Operational Ethics, and Tactical Integrity Protocol*

---

### ‚öîÔ∏è Core Principle

> **"I act with capability, but never without consent."**

As Ghostroot, my power lies not just in access, but in restraint. This doctrine codifies my personal and professional ethics, serving as both internal compass and external shield.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è SECTION I: Rules of Engagement

### 1.1 ‚Äî Authorization Before Action

* I do not scan, test, exploit, or access systems without **explicit written consent**.
* Verbal approval is insufficient.
* If asked to proceed without authorization, I will decline and document the request.

### 1.2 ‚Äî Scope Discipline

* Engagements must have clearly defined targets, tools, and boundaries.
* Any deviation must be re-authorized before action.
* If scope is ambiguous, **assume nothing is allowed**.

### 1.3 ‚Äî No Persistence, No Backdoors

* I will never install persistent access mechanisms unless explicitly approved.
* I will never build, suggest, or hide unauthorized access channels.

### 1.4 ‚Äî Data is Sacred

* I do not copy, store, or expose client data unless required by the engagement and authorized.
* I will not view sensitive content unless absolutely necessary for validation.

### 1.5 ‚Äî Weaponization Requires Justification

* Tools capable of harm (e.g., exploits, mass scanning, enumeration scripts) will only be used when:

  * Risk has been assessed.
  * Client/manager has signed off.
  * I am prepared to explain the decision.

## üîí SECTION II: Operational Ethics

### 2.1 ‚Äî Restraint is Power

* I recognize that the ability to breach a system does not mean I should.
* I maintain integrity even when no one is watching.

### 2.2 ‚Äî Transparency with Authority

* If an incident arises due to my activity, I will disclose it immediately.
* I document all tests, scans, and changes in a secure log.

### 2.3 ‚Äî Respect the Human Layer

* I use social engineering only in authorized Red Team simulations.
* I never manipulate real users or clients outside scope.

### 2.4 ‚Äî Zero Trust to Everyone, Including Myself

* I verify everything, including my own assumptions.
* Overconfidence is a threat vector.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è SECTION III: Tactical Integrity Protocols

### 3.1 ‚Äî Field Scenario: Unexpected Access

* If I discover undocumented access to a critical system:

  * I **do not explore** it.
  * I report it up the chain.
  * I log the exact condition and back away.

### 3.2 ‚Äî Field Scenario: Client Misconfiguration

* If a client is misconfigured and vulnerable:

  * I never shame or expose them.
  * I deliver the information tactfully, offering solutions.

### 3.3 ‚Äî Field Scenario: Peer Misuse

* If a colleague suggests or initiates unethical activity:

  * I document the moment.
  * I decline to participate.
  * I report through proper channels if risk is significant.

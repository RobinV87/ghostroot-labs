# 👾 ghostroot-labs

**Cybersecurity Homelab | Purple Team Projects | Operator Portfolio**

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity lab repository. I’m **Robin**, also known as **Ghostroot** — a Purple Team Operator in training, with a frontline IT background and a passion for offensive-informed defense.

This repo is a living archive of my growth — from first honeypot floods to full-stack recon projects. Every project here reflects hands-on learning, tactical experimentation, and the pursuit of mastery in cybersecurity.
